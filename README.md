# stateversion

Creates a transport client to a cluster node, grabs its local state,
and prints the version.  Must be run on the machine where the node is
running to give sensible IPs and timestamp.

## Usage

    % ./stateversion -h
    usage: stateversion [CLUSTER] [HOST] [PORT]
    % ./stateversion drewr
